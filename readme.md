#Sprat

A microservices framework for independent publishing. Bundles CMS with self-hosted analytics and other tools to free site owners and users from Big Tech.

Development at very early stages here, so software is definitely only for testing, not production. 

Sprat is free to use under MIT license. Ideas, bug reports, pull requests, and other contributions to development are welcome via https://github.com/peteramckay/sprat

Cheers,
